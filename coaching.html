                <p><strong>Simple Contract &amp; Flexible Rates</strong>: If we see we’re a fit, we’ll sign a digital contract and start as soon as we both can! I am committed to creating a world where everyone is supported 100% and no one is left out. The rate I charge for coaching reflects this by having those who can pay more support me to offer lower rates to those who can pay only at lower levels. By paying the most authentic fee for yourself and your organization, you are helping ensure that my support is accessible. We'll work together to discover a rate that's right for you — an investment, not a hardship!</p>
