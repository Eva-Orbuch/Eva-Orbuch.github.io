                <h5>Individual Life and Leadership Coaching and Organizational Development Coaching</h5>
              
              <p>I work in a holistic way with individuals who are deeply committed to their lives and want support to grow in any or all of the following areas:</p>
              <p>Personal organization and time management</p>
                    <ul>
                            <li>Your personal leadership journey  </li>
                            <li>New managers in a workplace looking to be effective managers and run great teams</li>
                            <li>Creative goals (both the creative process and the business side of being an artist) </li>
                            <li>Finding your authentic activism, contributions to community, and an enriching political life </li>
                            <li>Connecting to your spiritual journey and ancestral/spiritual lineage </li>
                 </ul>
                <p>I also coach organizations, groups, or teams to assess their circumstances and what their goals for change are. I offer coaching, and plan and facilitate retreats or important meetings and group processes.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    “I was so impressed by the way Eva led our coaching sessions. She often started with a grounding practice, and then moved so thoughtfully and intentionally through the topics I wanted to focus on. Eva brought a clear sense of trust, compassion, and strategy to our work. At the end of each session I was left feeling more capacity and agency and also a sense of partnership and holding. I learned so much from the quality of grace and the can-do attitude that she modeled in our work together.”<br/>-- Sarah Salem
