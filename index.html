            <h2>About Eva</h2>
            <p>Eva Orbuch is a passionate justice seeker and organizer of beautiful trouble. Eva dedicates herself to community building in the Bay Area where she has lived her whole life, through music, women’s circles (both in and outside of At the Well), and more. She is a Moon Dancer (a women’s Mexican spiritual tradition) and Kohenet (Hebrew Priestess) in training. She loves to support and coach people in finding their authentic activism.</p>

            -explain summary of all 5 offerings

                  </p>

            <h2>Offerings (drop down menu with 5 offerings)</h2>


            On the Offerings page, combine all my list of offerings on different pages- listed in the following order. Each of these has a slightly different audience, but it should not be a problem to have them on the same site. 

            <h1>Coaching - Individual Life and Leadership Coaching and Organizational Development Coaching</h1>

            <h2>Ritual Creation and Circle Facilitation</h2>
                <p>I work with individuals and groups to create and craft unique rituals for the larger or smaller life cycle moments. Transitions deserve attention. A ritual is a beautiful way of putting attention on something, and it can be quite healing to both create and experience it. I will work with you to intuitively design rituals that are authentic to you and your circumstance, and then support you to enact them. We will incorporate elements of nature, embodiment, symbolism that is personally significant to you, solo or communal, and a supportive plan for accountability/implementation.</p>
                <p>I am a coach for <a href="https://www.atthewellproject.com/start-a-well-circle">At the Well</a>, an organization that connects women around the world through transformative practices inspired by ancient Jewish Wisdom.</p>
          
            <p>Read about my experience with my own moon <a href="https://www.atthewellproject.com/blog/moon-circling-during-a-pandemic">circle here</a>.</p>

            -I also facilitate circles in Spanish for Latin American immigrant women who want to explore sisterhood, personal growth, and spirituality. 

           <h2> Community Organizing/Advocacy/Political campaign Training and Education Consulting</h2>
                   <p>I have an expertise in community organizing, and have been trained diligently in the PICO organizing model (Pacific Institute for Community Organizing). I have organized with majority Latino immigrant communities, as well as African American, Pacific Islander, and White communities around the Bay Area. I have built coalitions and partnerships with faith based organizations and many non-profit and government agencies. I have also worked on electoral campaigns, managing volunteers and both in person and digital canvassing strategy. I consult and train on strategy, campaign development, and the basic skills and building blocks of organizing, such as one to one relational meetings, research meetings, and public actions.</p>

                    <p>I taught middle school and gained a Master’s in Urban Education with a concentration on Policy and Administration. I have deep experience working with the public school system and focusing on a stakeholder group often left out, families. I consult and train on family and community engagement strategies in the movement for increased education justice.  </p>
          
          <h2>Rates</h2>

            <p>My rates are currently set up on a sliding-scale basis. Please get in touch with me to schedule a free consultation or request more information!</p>

            <p>Simple Contract &amp; Flexible Rates: If we see we’re a fit, we’ll sign a digital contract and start as soon as we both can! I offer all of my services based on a sliding scale of $70/$150/$230 per hour. I am committed to creating a world where everyone is supported 100% and no one is left out. The rate I charge for coaching reflects this by having those who can pay more support me to offer lower rates to those who can pay only at lower levels. By paying the most authentic fee for yourself and your organization, you are helping ensure that my support is accessible. We'll work together to discover a rate that's right for you -- an investment, not a hardship!</p>

           <h2>Spanish-English Interpretation</h2> 
               <p>I am fluent in conversational Spanish, and can interpret simultaneously or consecutively between English and Spanish. </p>

            <h1>Musical Offerings </h1>
            <p>-I offer 1-1 coaching that I lovingly call serving as a “drum doula.” I work with clients who feel called to build their relationship with drumming- primarily hand drums. We aim to work together for 6 months, which is a length of time allowing for deep unfolding of the coaching process and sufficient time to meet many of your goals around drumming. We meet every two, 3, or 4 weeks. Things to work on include: 
            research into different drum lineages and figuring out which one to start with
            becoming observant of rhythm, and applying nature awareness skills 
            getting into a "rhythm" of playing and practicing - both alone, and with others
            confidence in drumming, making noise, and how this translates to other parts of your life!</p>

               <h3> -She Drums- an <a href="https://www.shedrumsproject.com/">in-process documentary film project</a>. </h3>
             <p>She Drums is a journey through rhythm, voice, culture, and exploring the destinies of female drummers. Enjoy interviews and percussion footage of over 30 female drummers from a variety of cultural backgrounds living in or with connection to the San Francisco Bay Area. </p>
