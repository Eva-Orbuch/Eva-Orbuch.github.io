                                Eva mentored me weekly while I was in charge of volunteer coordination on a local campaign. She was very consistent with her check-ins, which is important for a fast-paced environment. She made sure I wasn’t so laser-focused on the everyday grind and encouraged me to occasionally step back and consider strategy and efficiency.  During our weekly calls, she brought up what I had committed to do in our previous call and asked about my progress. She was always kind and I never felt pressured, but at the same time she was able to make sure I followed through on my commitments. She made sure to hold space for my ideas and thoughts and always helped me think through them.  She also offered tangible ideas that I could implement immediately after our phone calls. She has the experience to consider small details that may go amiss to somebody new to organizing...Needless to say, our campaign made it to the runoff in a competitive, well-funded 5-way primary, and I would argue it was because of our people power and effective organization that pushed us over one step closer to victory.
