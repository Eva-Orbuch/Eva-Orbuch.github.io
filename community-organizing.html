               <h2>Community Organizing/Advocacy/Political campaign Training and Education Consulting</h2>

                    <p>I have an expertise in community organizing, and have been trained diligently in the PICO organizing model (Pacific Institute for Community Organizing). I have organized with majority Latino immigrant communities, as well as African American, Pacific Islander, and White communities around the Bay Area. I have built coalitions and partnerships with faith based organizations and many non-profit and government agencies. I have also worked on electoral campaigns, managing volunteers and both in person and digital canvassing strategy. I consult and train on strategy, campaign development, and the basic skills and building blocks of organizing, such as one to one relational meetings, research meetings, and public actions.</p>

                    <p>I taught middle school and gained a Master’s in Urban Education with a concentration on Policy and Administration. I have deep experience working with the public school system and focusing on a stakeholder group often left out, families. I consult and train on family and community engagement strategies in the movement for increased education justice.  </p>

                <p><strong>Simple Contract &amp; Flexible Rates</strong>: If we see we’re a fit, we’ll sign a digital contract and start as soon as we both can! I am committed to creating a world where everyone is supported 100% and no one is left out. The rate I charge for coaching reflects this by having those who can pay more support me to offer lower rates to those who can pay only at lower levels. By paying the most authentic fee for yourself and your organization, you are helping ensure that my support is accessible. We'll work together to discover a rate that's right for you — an investment, not a hardship!</p>
