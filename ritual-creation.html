                <a class="anchor" name="ritual"></a>
                    <p>I work with individuals and groups to create and craft unique rituals for the larger or smaller life cycle moments. Transitions deserve attention. A ritual is a beautiful way of putting attention on something, and it can be quite healing to both create and experience it. I will work with you to intuitively design rituals that are authentic to you and your circumstance, and then support you to enact them. We will incorporate elements of nature, embodiment, symbolism that is personally significant to you, solo or communal, and a supportive plan for accountability/implementation.</p>
                    <p>I am a coach for <a href="https://www.atthewellproject.com/start-a-well-circle">At the Well</a>, an organization that connects women around the world through transformative practices inspired by ancient Jewish Wisdom.</p>

                <p>Read about my experience with my own moon <a href="https://www.atthewellproject.com/blog/moon-circling-during-a-pandemic">circle here</a>.</p>

                -I also facilitate circles in Spanish for Latin American immigrant women who want to explore sisterhood, personal growth, and spirituality.

                <p><strong>Simple Contract &amp; Flexible Rates</strong>: If we see we’re a fit, we’ll sign a digital contract and start as soon as we both can! I am committed to creating a world where everyone is supported 100% and no one is left out. The rate I charge for coaching reflects this by having those who can pay more support me to offer lower rates to those who can pay only at lower levels. By paying the most authentic fee for yourself and your organization, you are helping ensure that my support is accessible. We'll work together to discover a rate that's right for you — an investment, not a hardship!</p>
