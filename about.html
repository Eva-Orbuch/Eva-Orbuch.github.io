                <p>Eva is a passionate facilitator, trainer, coach, community organizer, musician, ritual guide, and child of the earth. She dedicates herself to community building in the Bay Area where she has lived her whole life. She had her first experiences with progressive activism at age 14 and has continued down that path since then. As she continues to explore her own role in justice movements, she also loves to support and coach people in finding their authentic activism.</p>
              
              <p>Eva is currently undergoing her coach training with the Coactive Training Institute. Eva has a B.A. in Urban Studies and a Masters in Urban Education. She has worked deeply with both youth and adults, first as a middle school teacher and then as a community organizer with primarily low-income and immigrant families dedicated to helping their children and communities access educational rights. In that role, she also built partnerships amongst a variety of stakeholders, such as non profit organizations, businesses, faith organizations, and government. She currently works as a consultant, supporting workplaces to have a more human approach and to develop the leadership of their employees.</p>

                <p>Eva weaves a variety of spiritual practices into her life, from meditation and nature awareness, to being a Moon Dancer and a Kohenet (Hebrew Priestess) in training. She considers all of her offerings a part of her priestessing- from the super practical to the spiritual realms, and in between!</p>

                <p>Eva currently resides in Berkeley, California on unceded Coast Miwok and Chochenyo Ohlone land, in a cooperative house full of humans, plants, and yummy treats.</p>
