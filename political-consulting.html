               <h2>Community Organizing, Advocacy, Political campaign Training and Education Consulting</h2>

                    <p>I have an expertise in community organizing, and have been trained diligently in the PICO organizing model (Pacific Institute for Community Organizing). I have organized with majority Latino immigrant communities, as well as African American, Pacific Islander, and White communities around the Bay Area. I have built coalitions and partnerships with faith based organizations and many non-profit and government agencies. I have also worked on electoral campaigns, managing volunteers and both in person and digital canvassing strategy. I consult and train on strategy, campaign development, and the basic skills and building blocks of organizing, such as one to one relational meetings, research meetings, and public actions.</p>

                    <p>I taught middle school and gained a Master’s in Urban Education with a concentration on Policy and Administration. I have deep experience working with the public school system and focusing on a stakeholder group often left out, families. I consult and train on family and community engagement strategies in the movement for increased education justice.  </p>

                                Eva mentored me weekly while I was in charge of volunteer coordination on a local campaign. She was very consistent with her check-ins, which is important for a fast-paced environment. She made sure I wasn’t so laser-focused on the everyday grind and encouraged me to occasionally step back and consider strategy and efficiency.  During our weekly calls, she brought up what I had committed to do in our previous call and asked about my progress. She was always kind and I never felt pressured, but at the same time she was able to make sure I followed through on my commitments. She made sure to hold space for my ideas and thoughts and always helped me think through them.  She also offered tangible ideas that I could implement immediately after our phone calls. She has the experience to consider small details that may go amiss to somebody new to organizing...Needless to say, our campaign made it to the runoff in a competitive, well-funded 5-way primary, and I would argue it was because of our people power and effective organization that pushed us over one step closer to victory.

You gave me some great tips and really boosted my confidence- the last couple days I feel like I really hit my stride, and I’m looking forward to getting out the vote again in future elections! </blockquote>
