                <p><img src="IMG/drum-doula.png" />I offer 1-1 coaching that I lovingly call serving as a “drum doula.” I work with clients who feel called to build their relationship with drumming- primarily hand drums. We aim to work together for 6 months, which is a length of time allowing for deep unfolding of the coaching process and sufficient time to meet many of your goals around drumming. We meet every two, 3, or 4 weeks. Things to work on include: 
                research into different drum lineages and figuring out which one to start with
                becoming observant of rhythm, and applying nature awareness skills 
                getting into a "rhythm" of playing and practicing - both alone, and with others
                confidence in drumming, making noise, and how this translates to other parts of your life!</p>
